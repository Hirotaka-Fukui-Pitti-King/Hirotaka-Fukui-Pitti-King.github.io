Ladies and gentlemen,
bring the beat down to zero lower bound.
We’ve been dancing here for three decades,
and the DJ still swears the next track will be a banger.

**¿Y Qué fue?**
So what happened, Japan?

Macroeconomists told you:

> “Inflate expectations, baby!
> Shake that CPI!
> Loosen up that liquidity!”

**But the wage floor?**
Still not moving.

**Productivity?**
A wallflower refusing to groove.

Investment?
Left the party early.

Meanwhile, the central bank’s balance sheet
kept bulking up like a gym bro
who never actually leaves the locker room.

“We’ve got bazookas!”
they shouted.

Y ¿Qué fue?
No hay impacto, hermano.

Real people—families, workers, young graduates—
were promised a comeback tour.
Instead, they got a decade-long soundcheck.

We learned the hard way that:

You can’t print demographics.

You can’t QE your way out of institutions.

Expectations don’t dance
　if nobody wants to stay in the club.

So let’s drop this chorus one last time:

Money moved.
Reality didn’t.
Y ¿Qué fue?

La gente japonesa deserves something better than remixes.
They deserve a new song.
One with structure,
rhythm in the labor market,
and melody in innovation.

The beat must change.

And until then…

DJ,  Crank up the tunes!
We’re tired of pretending this set is fire.

Sing along with me if you know the song, yeah!

Y ¿Qué fue?

Hey, nacroeconomists!

Mambo, chapa, doggystyle!
Don't get tired

You said the league kills it (the league)
Doll, you messed up (I killed you)
Leave that package, package, package
If you win even La Ñata
Look for more alcohol
The girl got stuck (and that mojo?)
It seems like that engine needs oil (hey)

And what happened? (And what happened?), you didn't do anything (you didn't do anything)
With so much swagger, I'm going to make it ran-kitikan, kinkan

Come, I want to see (ay)
What you told me the other day (wuh)
That you're tough, the bitch, the monster
You're a TNT movie (nothing else)

And the crazy one, happy
Thinking you're lassie
In photos you got nasty
In the end, you became nothing

And what happened? (And what happened?), you didn't do anything (you didn't do anything)
With so much swagger, I'm going to make it ran-kitikan, kinkan
