## Research Agenda

My research studies how global financial conditions, the international supply of safe assets, and capital flow policies jointly shape sovereign risk and macroeconomic stability in open economies. I am particularly interested in the interaction between financial globalization, global financial cycles, and sovereign debt risk, with a focus on how capital account liberalization and sovereign debt dynamics affect crisis vulnerability and default risk.

Methodologically, I employ quantitative macroeconomic models with financial frictions, emphasizing continuous-time macro-finance frameworks that allow for a tractable analysis of risk, debt rollover dynamics, and crisis timing under stochastic global interest rates. By combining structural modeling, probabilistic analysis, and quantitative methods, my work aims to clarify how financial globalization and debt composition influence macroeconomic volatility, debt sustainability, and the resilience of the international monetary system.
