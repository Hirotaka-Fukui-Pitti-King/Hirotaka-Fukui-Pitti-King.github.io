## Research Agenda

My research studies how global financial forces shape macroeconomic stability and fluctuations in open economies, with a particular focus on emerging markets. I examine how global financial conditions, the international supply of safe assets, and capital flow policies interact with sovereign debt dynamics and domestic financial frictions.

Across these approaches, my goal is to understand how financial globalization and external shocks transmit into domestic macroeconomic volatility, sovereign risk, and business cycle dynamics.
