# Starting Point

In a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium framework, the optimality conditions and market clearing conditions for households, firms, and policymakers can be summarized as a system of nonlinear expectational equations:

$$
    \mathbb{E} F(x_{t+1}, y_{t+1}, x_t, y_t, z_t; \theta) = 0
$$

where

- $x_t \in \mathbb{R}^{n_x}$ denotes the **state (predetermined) variables**

- $y_t \in \mathbb{R}^{n_y}$ represents the **jump (control) variables**

- $z_t \in \mathbb{R}^{n_z}$ stands for the **exogenous processes**, which typically evolve according to

$$
        z_{t+1} = \Lambda(\theta) z_t + \Sigma(\theta) \varepsilon_{t+1}, 
        \quad \varepsilon_t \sim \mathcal{N}(0, I).
$$

- $\theta$ is the parameter vector collecting structural parameters of the model.

The function $F(\cdot) = 0$ is a compact representation of a set of equilibrium conditions, including the Euler equations, labor supply conditions, price-setting equations, capital accumulation dynamics, policy rules, etc.

## Example: A structure incorporating the Euler equation of a representative household

An illustrative framework embedding the Euler equation characterizing the intertemporal optimization behavior of a representative household.

The representative household maximizes expected lifetime utility:

$$
    \max_{c_{t}, k_{t+1}, n_{t}} \mathbb{E}_{0} \sum^{\infty}_{t=0} \beta^{t} U(c_{t}, 1-n_{t})
$$

subject to the intertemporal budget constraint:

$$
 c_{t}+k_{t+1} = (1-\delta)k_{t}+w_{t}n_{t}+r_{t}k_{t}
$$

### First-Order Conditions (Interior Solution)

From the optimallity conditions, we obtain:

1. $\lambda_{t} = U_{c}(c_{t}, 1-n_{t})$
2. $\lambda_{t} = -U_{n}(c_{t}, 1-n_{t})/w_{t}$
3. $\lambda_{t} = \beta \mathbb{E}_{t}[ \lambda_{t+1} (r_{t+1}+1-\delta) ] $

From equations (1) and (3), we obtain the canonical Euler equation, which characterizes the intertemporal trade-off in consumption.

By substituting equations (1) through (3) into the system and rearranging, the model can be expressed in the form of a moment condition:

$$
    \mathbb{E}_{t}\Biggl[ F(x_{t+1}, y_{t+1}, x_{t}, y_{t}, z_{t}; \theta) \Biggr] = 0
$$

This formulation embeds the Euler condition within a broader structural framework suitable for estimation or simulation.

# Balanced growth Path

In the deterministic version of the model, where stochastic shocks are turned off, the growth trend is governed by the following law of motion:

$$
 z_{t+1} = \Lambda(\theta)z_{t}+\Sigma(\theta)\epsilon_{t+1}
$$

In this setting, many endogenous variables evolve proportionally to the growth trend, typically taking the form:

$$
    x_{t} = \tilde{x} \cdot z_{t}
$$

This formulation implies that the dynamics of key macroeconomic variables are scaled by the underlying growth process, reflecting balanced growth path behavior in the absence of uncertainty.

## Balanced Growth Path

A path $\{C_t, K_t, Y_t\}_{t=0}^{\infty}$ is called a **Balanced Growth Path (BGP)** if there exists a constant $g \in \mathbb{R}$ such that
$$
\begin{align}
\ln \frac{C_{t+1}}{C_t} = \ln \frac{K_{t+1}}{K_t} = \ln \frac{Y_{t+1}}{Y_t} = g
\quad \forall t \ge 0.
\end{align}
$$

Equivalently, $C_t = C_0 e^{gt}$, $K_t = K_0 e^{gt}$, and $Y_t = Y_0 e^{gt}$.

## Balanced Growth Path: Existence and Uniqueness

Consider a discrete-time economy described by the following system:
$$
\begin{align}
K_{t+1} &= F(K_t, L_t) - C_t - \delta K_t, \\
L_{t+1} &= (1+n)L_t, \\
U_0 &= \sum_{t=0}^{\infty} \beta^t u(C_t),
\end{align}
$$
where $K_t$ is capital, $L_t$ is labor, $C_t$ is consumption, $\delta \in (0,1)$ is the depreciation rate, and $\beta \in (0,1)$ is the discount factor.

Then the following two statements are equivalent:

1. There exists at least one Balanced Growth Path in the economy.
2. The production function $F$ and the utility function $u$ satisfy the following **monotonic scalar transformation conditions**:
   $$
    \begin{align}
    F(aK, aL) &= a\, F(K,L), \quad \forall a>0, \\
    u(aC) &= \phi(a)\, u(C), \quad \forall a>0,
    \end{align}
   $$
   where $\phi:\mathbb{R}_+ \to \mathbb{R}_+$ is continuous and strictly monotone increasing.

Moreover, if $\phi(a)$ is strictly monotone, then the Balanced Growth Path is unique.

## General Framework

### Production
Aggregate output is produced according to the following production function:

$$
    Y_{t} = A_{t}F(K_{t}, N_{t}L_{t})
$$

where:

- $A_{t}$ denotes the level of technology,
- $K_{t}$ represents the aggregate capital,
- $N_{t}, L_{t}$ is the population and the employment rate, respectively.

#### Assumption T1 (Constant Returns to Scale)
The production function $F: \mathbb{R}^2_{+} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}_{+}$ is assumed to be continuous, quasi-concave, and homogeneous of degree one in reproducible factors $(K, NL)$, satisfying constant returns to scale (CRS).

### Exogenous Growth
Technological progress and population growth follow deterministic exponential trends:

$$
\begin{align}
    A_{t+1} & = (1+g_{A})A_{t}, \\
    N_{t+1} & = (1+g_{N})N_{t}
\end{align}
$$

#### Assumption T2
The growth rates $g_{A}, g_{N} \geq 0$ are constant and exogenously given.

### Capital Accumulation
Capital evolves according to the standard law of motion:

$$
    K_{t+1} = (1-\delta)K_{t}+I_{t}
$$

### Preferences
The representative household maximizes lifetime utility given by:

$$
    U = \sum^{\infty}_{t=0} \beta^t u(C_{t}, 1-L_{t})
$$

with the period utility function specified as a generalized separable CRRA form:
