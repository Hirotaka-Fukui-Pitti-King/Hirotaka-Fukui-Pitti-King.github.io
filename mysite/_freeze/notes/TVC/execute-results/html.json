It offers the first rigorous extension of the finite-horizon Maximum Principle to the infinite-horizon setting via a limiting argument.\n2. In doing so, he demonstrates that the standard Transversality Condition (TVC) does not generally hold through explicit counterexamples.\n\nHalkin develops the infinite-horizon problem as the limit of finite-horizon problems and establishes the corresponding necessary conditions.\nThe results prompted Michel to ask what boundary condition does hold in general, leading him to show that, although the TVC may fail, the Hamiltonian necessarily converges to zero in the limit.\n\n### Finite Horizon Problem\n\nBegin by recalling the standard finite-horizon optimal control problem:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\n  \\max_{u(\\cdot)} ~& \\int^{T}_{0} L(x(t), u(t), t) dt \\\\\n  s.t. ~& \\dot{x}(t) = f(x(t), u(t), t), \\\\\n       & x(0) = 0, \\\\\n       & h(x(T)) = 0. \n\\end{align}\n$$\n\nThe Hamiltonian is defined as\n\n$$\n  H(x, u, t, \\mu, \\lambda) = \\lambda^{\\top} f(x, u, t) + \\mu L(x(t), u(t), t)\n$$\n\nPontryagin’s Maximum Principle can then be written as follows:\n\n1. $\\mu(t), \\lambda(t) \\neq 0$;\n2. $\\dot{\\lambda}(t) = -H_{x}$;\n3. $H(x(t), u^{*}(t), t) \\geq H(x(t), u(t), t)$ for all feasible $u$;\n4. Boundary conditions at the terminal time $T$:\n   - Free end point: $\\lambda(T) = 0$,\n   - Clamped (fixed) end point: $\\lambda(T)$ is unrestricted.\n\nNote that the free-end-point condition corresponds to the transversality condition for the finite-horizon problem.\n\n",
