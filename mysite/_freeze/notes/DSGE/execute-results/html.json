There exists at least one Balanced Growth Path in the economy.\n2. The production function $F$ and the utility function $u$ satisfy the following **monotonic scalar transformation conditions**:\n   $$\n    \\begin{align}\n    F(aK, aL) &= a\\, F(K,L), \\quad \\forall a>0, \\\\\n    u(aC) &= \\phi(a)\\, u(C), \\quad \\forall a>0,\n    \\end{align}\n   $$\n   where $\\phi:\\mathbb{R}_+ \\to \\mathbb{R}_+$ is continuous and strictly monotone increasing.\n\nMoreover, if $\\phi(a)$ is strictly monotone, then the Balanced Growth Path is unique.\n:::\n\n::: {.proof}\n\n## General Framework\n\n### Production\nAggregate output is produced according to the following production function:\n\n$$\n    Y_{t} = A_{t}F(K_{t}, N_{t}L_{t})\n$$\n\nwhere:\n\n- $A_{t}$ denotes the level of technology,\n- $K_{t}$ represents the aggregate capital,\n- $N_{t}, L_{t}$ is the population and the employment rate, respectively.\n\n#### Assumption T1 (Constant Returns to Scale)\nThe production function $F: \\mathbb{R}^2_{+} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}_{+}$ is assumed to be continuous, quasi-concave, and homogeneous of degree one in reproducible factors $(K, NL)$, satisfying constant returns to scale (CRS).\n\n### Exogenous Growth\nTechnological progress and population growth follow deterministic exponential trends:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\n    A_{t+1} & = (1+g_{A})A_{t}, \\\\\n    N_{t+1} & = (1+g_{N})N_{t}\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\n#### Assumption T2\nThe growth rates $g_{A}, g_{N} \\geq 0$ are constant and exogenously given.\n\n### Capital Accumulation\nCapital evolves according to the standard law of motion:\n\n$$\n    K_{t+1} = (1-\\delta)K_{t}+I_{t}\n$$\n\n### Preferences\nThe representative household maximizes lifetime utility given by:\n\n$$\n    U = \\sum^{\\infty}_{t=0} \\beta^t u(C_{t}, 1-L_{t})\n$$\n\nwith the period utility function specified as a generalized separable CRRA form:\n\n:::\n\n",
