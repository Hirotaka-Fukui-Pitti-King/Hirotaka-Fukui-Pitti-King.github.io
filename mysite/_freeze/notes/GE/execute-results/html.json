The analysis is therefore organized around the concept of a price system or, more generally, of a value function defined on the commodity space.”  \n> — Gérard Debreu, *The Theory of Value* \n\nNow, let us view a competitive economy from the general equilibrium perspective.\nAs Debreu (1959) emphasizes, general equilibrium theory seeks to explain how the prices of commodities emerge from the interactions of agents in a market economy, and how those prices, in turn, sustain an optimal allocation of resources.\n\nConsider an economy with $H$ commodities indexed by $h \\in \\mathcal{H} = {1, \\dots, H}$, $I$ consumers indexed by $i \\in \\mathcal{I} = {1, \\dots, I}$, and $J$ producers or firms indexed by $j \\in \\mathcal{J} = {1, \\dots, J}$.\n\nConsumers derive utility from consuming goods. Let $X$ denote the **consumption correspondence**, which maps each consumer $i \\in \\mathcal{I}$ to a subset $X(i) = X_i \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}^{\\mathcal{H}}$ of the commodity space, representing the set of consumption bundles available to that consumer.\nEach element $x_i \\in X_i$ is a **consumption bundle** (or consumption vector), describing quantities of all commodities that the consumer may feasibly consume.\n\nLet $R$ be a **preference correspondence** that maps each $i \\in \\mathcal{I}$ to a reflexive binary relation $R(i) = R_i \\subseteq X_i \\times X_i$ over $X_i$, representing the consumer’s preference ordering such that $(x_i, x_i) \\in R_i$ for all $x_i \\in X_i$.\n\nEach producer $j \\in \\mathcal{J}$ operates a **production set** $Y(j) = Y_j \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}^{\\mathcal{H}}$, where each element $y_j \\in Y_j$ is a **production bundle** (or production vector) describing quantities of inputs and outputs across commodities.\n\nThe total resources available in the economy are represented by an **aggregate endowment vector** $\\bar{\\omega} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{\\mathcal{H}}$, where $\\bar{\\omega} = (\\bar{\\omega}(h))_{h \\in \\mathcal{H}} = (\\bar{\\omega}h)_{h \\in \\mathcal{H}}$ specifies the total amount of each commodity in the economy, not necessarily individualized among agents.\nThese commodities are assumed to be pre-existing and dated. It means that each good has a defined origin in time.\n\n::: {#def-econ}\n\n## Economy\n\nThe list $(\\mathcal{H}, \\mathcal{I}, \\mathcal{J}, X, R, Y, \\bar{\\omega})$ is an economy if\n\n1. $\\mathcal{H}$ is a nonempty finite set of commodities;\n1. $\\mathcal{I}$ is a nonempty finite set of consumers;\n1. $\\mathcal{J}$ is a nonempty finite set of producers or firms;\n1. $X$ is a correspondence from $\\mathcal{I}$ to the commodity space $\\mathbb{R}^{\\mathcal{H}}$;\n1. $R$ is a correspondence from $\\mathcal{I}$ to $\\mathbb{R}^{\\mathcal{H}} \\times \\mathbb{R}^{\\mathcal{H}}$ such that $R(i)$ is a reflexive binary relation over $X_{i}$ s.t. $(x_{i},x_{i}) \\in R_{i}$ for each $x_{i} \\in X_{i}$;\n1. $Y$ is a correspondence from $\\mathcal{J}$ to $\\mathbb{R}^{\\mathcal{H}}$; and\n1. $\\bar{\\omega}$ is a point of $\\mathbb{R}^{\\mathcal{H}}$.\n:::\n\n::: {#def-FeaAlo}\n\n## Feasible Allocation\n\nLet $(\\mathcal{H}, \\mathcal{I}, \\mathcal{J}, X, R, Y, \\bar{\\omega})$ be an economy. Then $(x, y) \\in (\\mathbb{R}^{\\mathcal{H}})^{\\mathcal{I}} \\times (\\mathbb{R}^{\\mathcal{H}})^{\\mathcal{J}}$ is a feasible allocation for $(\\mathcal{H}, \\mathcal{I}, \\mathcal{J}, X, R, Y, \\bar{\\omega})$ if $(x, y) \\in X \\times Y$ and $\\sum_{i \\in \\mathcal{I}}x_{i}=\\bar{\\omega}+\\sum_{j \\in \\mathcal{J}}y_{i}$.\n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-important}\nAll rights reserved.
