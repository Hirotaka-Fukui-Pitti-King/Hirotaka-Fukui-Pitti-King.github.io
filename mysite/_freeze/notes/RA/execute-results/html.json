This simplification builds on the Second Fundamental Theorem of Welfare Economics, which shows that a social planner can achieve a Pareto-efficient allocation of resources. By assigning proper welfare weights to each household, a centralized economy can replicate the outcomes of competitive markets.\n\nHowever, assuming that one individual can represent an entire population is a strong abstraction. It ignores differences in income, preferences, and opportunities across people. Recent studies have moved beyond this idea, developing models that incorporate household heterogeneity and inequality.\n\nEven so, the representative individual remains central to modern macroeconomics. Critics, following the Debreu–Sonnenschein–Mantel theorem, argue that aggregating individual behavior into a single agent is theoretically inconsistent. Others see it as a useful simplification that can approximate aggregate outcomes under certain assumptions.\n\n## Debreu-Mantel-Sonnenschein Theorem\n\nWhen studying how prices and income affect demand, economists usually work with market-level data rather than household-level observations. For businesses and policymakers, what matters is the overall demand curve, not each household’s choices. Ideally, a few parameters could summarize how total demand responds to changes in prices and income.\n\nThis raises a key question: if we only observe aggregate data, what kind of utility function should we assume for individuals? Microeconomic theory provides clear conditions---such as convex, continuous, and transitive preferences---under which individual demand satisfies symmetry, homogeneity, and the weak axiom of revealed preference.\n\nYet these properties do not necessarily hold when we aggregate across many households. Market demand may behave quite differently from individual demand. Even if individual preferences are non-convex, the overall demand function can still appear smooth and continuous. This insight lies at the heart of the Debreu–Sonnenschein–Mantel theorem, which shows that aggregate demand can take almost any shape consistent with Walras’ law and continuity, regardless of individual preferences.\n\n::: {#thm-DMS}\n\n## Debreu-Mantel-Sonnenschein Theorem\n\nLet $\\epsilon >0$ and $N \\in \\mathbb{N}$. Consider a set of prices $\\textbf{P}_{\\epsilon}=\\{p \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N}_{+}: p_{j}/p_{j'} \\geq \\epsilon,~\\forall j~\\text{and}~ j' \\}$ and any continuous function $\\textbf{x}: \\textbf{P}_{\\epsilon} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{N}_{+}$ that satisfies Walras's Law and is homogeneous of degree 0. Then there exists an exchange economy with $N$ commodities and $H<\\infty$ households, where the aggregate excess demand is given by $\\textbf{x}(p)$ over the set $\\textbf{P}_{\\epsilon}$\n\n:::\n\n",
