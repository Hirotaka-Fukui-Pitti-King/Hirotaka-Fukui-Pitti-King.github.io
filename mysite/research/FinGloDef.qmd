Building on a baseline continuous-time sovereign debt framework, I extend the model to incorporate a maturity structure of sovereign bonds, following the insights of Arellano and Ramanarayanan (2012) on the importance of debt maturity for default risk. The model features maturity-specific capital flow regulations and stochastic global interest rates, allowing me to study how liberalization of capital controls across different maturities affects sovereign risk and crisis vulnerability.

Using stochastic calculus and monotone comparative statics, I derive theoretical results on how maturity-dependent capital account liberalization influences default incentives and rollover risk. I then solve the model numerically to quantify the interaction between debt maturity, capital flow management policies, and global financial conditions in shaping sovereign risk.
