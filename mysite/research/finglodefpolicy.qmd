Building on a model with debt maturity structure and maturity-specific capital flow regulations, I study the design of optimal capital control policies in the presence of sovereign default risk. The framework allows capital account restrictions to vary across debt maturities, forming a “capital control portfolio” that shapes the composition of sovereign borrowing.

Using stochastic calculus and quantitative methods, I analyze how maturity-contingent capital controls can mitigate rollover risk, reduce default incentives, and enhance macro-financial stability under stochastic global interest rate shocks.
