I then solve the model numerically to quantify the interaction between debt maturity, capital flow management policies, and global financial conditions in shaping sovereign risk."

He formulated the infinite-horizon problem as the limit of finite-horizon problems and provided explicit counterexamples showing that\n\\[\n  \\lambda(t) \\rightarrow 0\n\\]\nis neither required nor generally valid.\nThis insight raised the fundamental question later pursued by Michel: what boundary condition should replace the TVC in full generality?\n\n\nStage 2: Michel (1982, 1990)\nMichel restored a general necessary boundary condition by showing that, under broad conditions, the Hamiltonian must converge to zero:\n\\[\n  \\lim_{t \\rightarrow \\infty} H(t) = 0\n\\]\nIn his 1982 paper he derived this limit rigorously within Halkin’s framework. His 1990 paper further showed its consistency with the Cass–Yaari lemma, and proved that, when the velocity set has a nonempty interior, the usual transversality condition\n\\[\n  \\lambda(t) \\rightarrow 0\n\\]\nis recovered.

By formalizing the Benveniste–Scheinkman envelope theorem and the “squeezing” argument, he established that the Euler equation and the envelope condition jointly imply\n\\[\n  \\lim_{t \\rightarrow \\infty} q(t) \\cdot x(t) = 0,\n\\]\nthereby deriving the TVC in a fully general setting. His results subsume and generalize Michel’s contributions, and are widely regarded as the modern definitive formulation of the TVC."

    "text": "Necessary Conditions for Optimal Control Problems with Infinite Horizons (Halkin, 1974)\nHalkin (1974) provides the first rigorous formulation of the Maximum Principle for infinite-horizon optimal control problems. The contribution of the paper is twofold.\n\nIt offers the first rigorous extension of the finite-horizon Maximum Principle to the infinite-horizon setting via a limiting argument.\nIn doing so, he demonstrates that the standard Transversality Condition (TVC) does not generally hold through explicit counterexamples.\n\nHalkin develops the infinite-horizon problem as the limit of finite-horizon problems and establishes the corresponding necessary conditions. The results prompted Michel to ask what boundary condition does hold in general, leading him to show that, although the TVC may fail, the Hamiltonian necessarily converges to zero in the limit.\n\nFinite Horizon Problem\nBegin by recalling the standard finite-horizon optimal control problem:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n  \\max_{u(\\cdot)} ~& \\int^{T}_{0} L(x(t), u(t), t) dt \\\\\n  s.t. ~& \\dot{x}(t) = f(x(t), u(t), t), \\\\\n       & x(0) = 0, \\\\\n       & h(x(T)) = 0.\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe Hamiltonian is defined as\n\\[\n  H(x, u, t, \\mu, \\lambda) = \\lambda^{\\top} f(x, u, t) + \\mu L(x(t), u(t), t)\n\\]\nPontryagin’s Maximum Principle can then be written as follows:\n\n\\(\\mu(t), \\lambda(t) \\neq 0\\);\n\\(\\dot{\\lambda}(t) = -H_{x}\\);\n\\(H(x(t), u^{*}(t), t) \\geq H(x(t), u(t), t)\\) for all feasible \\(u\\);\nBoundary conditions at the terminal time \\(T\\):\n\nFree end point: \\(\\lambda(T) = 0\\),\nClamped (fixed) end point: \\(\\lambda(T)\\) is unrestricted.\n\n\nNote that the free-end-point condition corresponds to the transversality condition for the finite-horizon problem."

    "text": "Debreu-Mantel-Sonnenschein Theorem\nWhen studying how prices and income affect demand, economists usually work with market-level data rather than household-level observations. For businesses and policymakers, what matters is the overall demand curve, not each household’s choices. Ideally, a few parameters could summarize how total demand responds to changes in prices and income.\nThis raises a key question: if we only observe aggregate data, what kind of utility function should we assume for individuals? Microeconomic theory provides clear conditions—such as convex, continuous, and transitive preferences—under which individual demand satisfies symmetry, homogeneity, and the weak axiom of revealed preference.\nYet these properties do not necessarily hold when we aggregate across many households. Market demand may behave quite differently from individual demand. Even if individual preferences are non-convex, the overall demand function can still appear smooth and continuous. This insight lies at the heart of the Debreu–Sonnenschein–Mantel theorem, which shows that aggregate demand can take almost any shape consistent with Walras’ law and continuity, regardless of individual preferences.\n\nTheorem 1 (Debreu-Mantel-Sonnenschein Theorem) Let \\(\\epsilon &gt;0\\) and \\(N \\in \\mathbb{N}\\). Consider a set of prices \\(\\textbf{P}_{\\epsilon}=\\{p \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N}_{+}: p_{j}/p_{j'} \\geq \\epsilon,~\\forall j~\\text{and}~ j' \\}\\) and any continuous function \\(\\textbf{x}: \\textbf{P}_{\\epsilon} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{N}_{+}\\) that satisfies Walras’s Law and is homogeneous of degree 0. Then there exists an exchange economy with \\(N\\) commodities and \\(H&lt;\\infty\\) households, where the aggregate excess demand is given by \\(\\textbf{x}(p)\\) over the set \\(\\textbf{P}_{\\epsilon}\\)"

The analysis is therefore organized around the concept of a price system or, more generally, of a value function defined on the commodity space.”\n— Gérard Debreu, The Theory of Value\n\nNow, let us view a competitive economy from the general equilibrium perspective. As Debreu (1959) emphasizes, general equilibrium theory seeks to explain how the prices of commodities emerge from the interactions of agents in a market economy, and how those prices, in turn, sustain an optimal allocation of resources.\nConsider an economy with \\(H\\) commodities indexed by \\(h \\in \\mathcal{H} = {1, \\dots, H}\\), \\(I\\) consumers indexed by \\(i \\in \\mathcal{I} = {1, \\dots, I}\\), and \\(J\\) producers or firms indexed by \\(j \\in \\mathcal{J} = {1, \\dots, J}\\).\nConsumers derive utility from consuming goods. Let \\(X\\) denote the consumption correspondence, which maps each consumer \\(i \\in \\mathcal{I}\\) to a subset \\(X(i) = X_i \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}^{\\mathcal{H}}\\) of the commodity space, representing the set of consumption bundles available to that consumer. Each element \\(x_i \\in X_i\\) is a consumption bundle (or consumption vector), describing quantities of all commodities that the consumer may feasibly consume.\nLet \\(R\\) be a preference correspondence that maps each \\(i \\in \\mathcal{I}\\) to a reflexive binary relation \\(R(i) = R_i \\subseteq X_i \\times X_i\\) over \\(X_i\\), representing the consumer’s preference ordering such that \\((x_i, x_i) \\in R_i\\) for all \\(x_i \\in X_i\\).\nEach producer \\(j \\in \\mathcal{J}\\) operates a production set \\(Y(j) = Y_j \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}^{\\mathcal{H}}\\), where each element \\(y_j \\in Y_j\\) is a production bundle (or production vector) describing quantities of inputs and outputs across commodities.\nThe total resources available in the economy are represented by an aggregate endowment vector \\(\\bar{\\omega} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{\\mathcal{H}}\\), where \\(\\bar{\\omega} = (\\bar{\\omega}(h))_{h \\in \\mathcal{H}} = (\\bar{\\omega}h)_{h \\in \\mathcal{H}}\\) specifies the total amount of each commodity in the economy, not necessarily individualized among agents. These commodities are assumed to be pre-existing and dated. It means that each good has a defined origin in time.\n\nDefinition 1 (Economy) The list \\((\\mathcal{H}, \\mathcal{I}, \\mathcal{J}, X, R, Y, \\bar{\\omega})\\) is an economy if\n\n\\(\\mathcal{H}\\) is a nonempty finite set of commodities;\n\\(\\mathcal{I}\\) is a nonempty finite set of consumers;\n\\(\\mathcal{J}\\) is a nonempty finite set of producers or firms;\n\\(X\\) is a correspondence from \\(\\mathcal{I}\\) to the commodity space \\(\\mathbb{R}^{\\mathcal{H}}\\);\n\\(R\\) is a correspondence from \\(\\mathcal{I}\\) to \\(\\mathbb{R}^{\\mathcal{H}} \\times \\mathbb{R}^{\\mathcal{H}}\\) such that \\(R(i)\\) is a reflexive binary relation over \\(X_{i}\\) s.t. \\((x_{i},x_{i}) \\in R_{i}\\) for each \\(x_{i} \\in X_{i}\\);\n\\(Y\\) is a correspondence from \\(\\mathcal{J}\\) to \\(\\mathbb{R}^{\\mathcal{H}}\\); and\n\\(\\bar{\\omega}\\) is a point of \\(\\mathbb{R}^{\\mathcal{H}}\\).\n\n\n\nDefinition 2 (Feasible Allocation) Let \\((\\mathcal{H}, \\mathcal{I}, \\mathcal{J}, X, R, Y, \\bar{\\omega})\\) be an economy. Then \\((x, y) \\in (\\mathbb{R}^{\\mathcal{H}})^{\\mathcal{I}} \\times (\\mathbb{R}^{\\mathcal{H}})^{\\mathcal{J}}\\) is a feasible allocation for \\((\\mathcal{H}, \\mathcal{I}, \\mathcal{J}, X, R, Y, \\bar{\\omega})\\) if \\((x, y) \\in X \\times Y\\) and \\(\\sum_{i \\in \\mathcal{I}}x_{i}=\\bar{\\omega}+\\sum_{j \\in \\mathcal{J}}y_{i}\\)."

    "section": "",
    "text": "This research examines the case of Ghana’s capital account liberalization for medium- and long-term sovereign bonds and its subsequent default approximately fifteen years later. I develop a continuous-time sovereign debt model with long-term bonds, capital flow frictions, and stochastic global interest rates to study how capital account liberalization affects sovereign risk and crisis dynamics.\nUsing stochastic calculus and monotone comparative statics, I provide theoretical results on how liberalization of capital controls on longer-maturity debt influences default risk and financial vulnerability. I then solve the model numerically by computing the associated Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman and Kolmogorov forward equations, and estimate the parameters using a modified simulated method of moments calibrated to Ghanaian macro-financial data.\nThis framework enables counterfactual experiments that quantify the relative importance of domestic financial liberalization versus external global financial conditions—captured by shifts in U.S. monetary policy and global interest rates—in driving Ghana’s rising sovereign risk prior to its default."
