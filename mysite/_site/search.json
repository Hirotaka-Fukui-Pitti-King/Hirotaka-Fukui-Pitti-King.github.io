If you find any errors, please get in touch with me.\n\n\n\nGeneral Equilibrium Theory\n\n“The two central problems of the theory that this monograph presents are (1) the explanation of the prices of commodities resulting from the interaction of the agents of a private ownership economy through markets, (2) the explanation of the role of prices in an optimal state of an economy. The analysis is therefore organized around the concept of a price system or, more generally, of a value function defined on the commodity space.”\n— Gérard Debreu, The Theory of Value\n\nNow, let us view a competitive economy from the general equilibrium perspective. As Debreu (1959) emphasizes, general equilibrium theory seeks to explain how the prices of commodities emerge from the interactions of agents in a market economy, and how those prices, in turn, sustain an optimal allocation of resources.\nConsider an economy with \\(H\\) commodities indexed by \\(h \\in \\mathcal{H} = {1, \\dots, H}\\), \\(I\\) consumers indexed by \\(i \\in \\mathcal{I} = {1, \\dots, I}\\), and \\(J\\) producers or firms indexed by \\(j \\in \\mathcal{J} = {1, \\dots, J}\\).\nConsumers derive utility from consuming goods. Let \\(X\\) denote the consumption correspondence, which maps each consumer \\(i \\in \\mathcal{I}\\) to a subset \\(X(i) = X_i \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}^{\\mathcal{H}}\\) of the commodity space, representing the set of consumption bundles available to that consumer. Each element \\(x_i \\in X_i\\) is a consumption bundle (or consumption vector), describing quantities of all commodities that the consumer may feasibly consume.\nLet \\(R\\) be a preference correspondence that maps each \\(i \\in \\mathcal{I}\\) to a reflexive binary relation \\(R(i) = R_i \\subseteq X_i \\times X_i\\) over \\(X_i\\), representing the consumer’s preference ordering such that \\((x_i, x_i) \\in R_i\\) for all \\(x_i \\in X_i\\).\nEach producer \\(j \\in \\mathcal{J}\\) operates a production set \\(Y(j) = Y_j \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}^{\\mathcal{H}}\\), where each element \\(y_j \\in Y_j\\) is a production bundle (or production vector) describing quantities of inputs and outputs across commodities.\nThe total resources available in the economy are represented by an aggregate endowment vector \\(\\bar{\\omega} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{\\mathcal{H}}\\), where \\(\\bar{\\omega} = (\\bar{\\omega}(h))_{h \\in \\mathcal{H}} = (\\bar{\\omega}h)_{h \\in \\mathcal{H}}\\) specifies the total amount of each commodity in the economy, not necessarily individualized among agents. These commodities are assumed to be pre-existing and dated. It means that each good has a defined origin in time.\n\nDefinition 1 (Economy) The list \\((\\mathcal{H}, \\mathcal{I}, \\mathcal{J}, X, R, Y, \\bar{\\omega})\\) is an economy if\n\n\\(\\mathcal{H}\\) is a nonempty finite set of commodities;\n\\(\\mathcal{I}\\) is a nonempty finite set of consumers;\n\\(\\mathcal{J}\\) is a nonempty finite set of producers or firms;\n\\(X\\) is a correspondence from \\(\\mathcal{I}\\) to the commodity space \\(\\mathbb{R}^{\\mathcal{H}}\\);\n\\(R\\) is a correspondence from \\(\\mathcal{I}\\) to \\(\\mathbb{R}^{\\mathcal{H}} \\times \\mathbb{R}^{\\mathcal{H}}\\) such that \\(R(i)\\) is a reflexive binary relation over \\(X_{i}\\) s.t. \\((x_{i},x_{i}) \\in R_{i}\\) for each \\(x_{i} \\in X_{i}\\);\n\\(Y\\) is a correspondence from \\(\\mathcal{J}\\) to \\(\\mathbb{R}^{\\mathcal{H}}\\); and\n\\(\\bar{\\omega}\\) is a point of \\(\\mathbb{R}^{\\mathcal{H}}\\).\n\n\n\nDefinition 2 (Feasible Allocation) Let \\((\\mathcal{H}, \\mathcal{I}, \\mathcal{J}, X, R, Y, \\bar{\\omega})\\) be an economy. Then \\((x, y) \\in (\\mathbb{R}^{\\mathcal{H}})^{\\mathcal{I}} \\times (\\mathbb{R}^{\\mathcal{H}})^{\\mathcal{J}}\\) is a feasible allocation for \\((\\mathcal{H}, \\mathcal{I}, \\mathcal{J}, X, R, Y, \\bar{\\omega})\\) if \\((x, y) \\in X \\times Y\\) and \\(\\sum_{i \\in \\mathcal{I}}x_{i}=\\bar{\\omega}+\\sum_{j \\in \\mathcal{J}}y_{i}\\)."

Is it not, intellectually regarded, a very easy subject compared with the higher branches of philosophy and pure science? Yet good, or even competent, economists are the rarest of birds. An easy subject, at which very few excel! The paradox finds its explanation, perhaps, in that the master-economist must possess a rare combination of gifts. He must reach a high standard in several different directions and must combine talents not often found together. He must be mathematician, historian, statesman, philosopher—​in some degree. He must understand symbols and speak in words. He must contemplate the particular in terms of the general, and touch abstract and concrete in the same flight of thought. He must study the present in the light of the past for the purposes of the future. No part of man’s nature or his institutions must lie entirely outside his regard. He must be purposeful and disinterested in a simultaneous mood; as aloof and incorruptible as an artist, yet sometimes as near the earth as a politician.”\n\n\n\n— John Maynard Keynes, “Alfred Marshall, 1842–1924.” The Economic Journal (1924)"

    "text": "Debreu-Mantel-Sonnenschein Theorem\nWhen studying how prices and income affect demand, economists usually work with market-level data rather than household-level observations. For businesses and policymakers, what matters is the overall demand curve, not each household’s choices. Ideally, a few parameters could summarize how total demand responds to changes in prices and income.\nThis raises a key question: if we only observe aggregate data, what kind of utility function should we assume for individuals? Microeconomic theory provides clear conditions—such as convex, continuous, and transitive preferences—under which individual demand satisfies symmetry, homogeneity, and the weak axiom of revealed preference.\nYet these properties do not necessarily hold when we aggregate across many households. Market demand may behave quite differently from individual demand. Even if individual preferences are non-convex, the overall demand function can still appear smooth and continuous. This insight lies at the heart of the Debreu–Sonnenschein–Mantel theorem, which shows that aggregate demand can take almost any shape consistent with Walras’ law and continuity, regardless of individual preferences.\n\nTheorem 1 (Debreu-Mantel-Sonnenschein Theorem) Let \\(\\epsilon &gt;0\\) and \\(N \\in \\mathbb{N}\\). Consider a set of prices \\(\\textbf{P}_{\\epsilon}=\\{p \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N}_{+}: p_{j}/p_{j'} \\geq \\epsilon,~\\forall j~\\text{and}~ j' \\}\\) and any continuous function \\(\\textbf{x}: \\textbf{P}_{\\epsilon} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{N}_{+}\\) that satisfies Walras’s Law and is homogeneous of degree 0. Then there exists an exchange economy with \\(N\\) commodities and \\(H&lt;\\infty\\) households, where the aggregate excess demand is given by \\(\\textbf{x}(p)\\) over the set \\(\\textbf{P}_{\\epsilon}\\)"

His 1990 paper further showed its consistency with the Cass–Yaari lemma, and proved that, when the velocity set has a nonempty interior, the usual transversality condition\n\\[\n  \\lambda(t) \\rightarrow 0\n\\]\nis recovered. Michel’s formulation became the conceptual foundation of boundary conditions in modern economic theory such that Ramsey-Cass–Koopmans models, optimal taxation, and many others.\n\n\nStage 3: Kamihigashi (2001)\nKamihigashi proved that the transversality condition is indeed a necessary condition, even without assuming concavity, integrability, or boundedness. By formalizing the Benveniste–Scheinkman envelope theorem and the “squeezing” argument, he established that the Euler equation and the envelope condition jointly imply\n\\[\n  \\lim_{t \\rightarrow \\infty} q(t) \\cdot x(t) = 0,\n\\]\nthereby deriving the TVC in a fully general setting. His results subsume and generalize Michel’s contributions, and are widely regarded as the modern definitive formulation of the TVC."

    "text": "Necessary Conditions for Optimal Control Problems with Infinite Horizons (Halkin, 1974)\nHalkin (1974) provides the first rigorous formulation of the Maximum Principle for infinite-horizon optimal control problems. The contribution of the paper is twofold.\n\nIt offers the first rigorous extension of the finite-horizon Maximum Principle to the infinite-horizon setting via a limiting argument.\nIn doing so, he demonstrates that the standard Transversality Condition (TVC) does not generally hold through explicit counterexamples.\n\nHalkin develops the infinite-horizon problem as the limit of finite-horizon problems and establishes the corresponding necessary conditions. The results prompted Michel to ask what boundary condition does hold in general, leading him to show that, although the TVC may fail, the Hamiltonian necessarily converges to zero in the limit.\n\nFinite Horizon Problem\nBegin by recalling the standard finite-horizon optimal control problem:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n  \\max_{u(\\cdot)} ~& \\int^{T}_{0} L(x(t), u(t), t) dt \\\\\n  s.t. ~& \\dot{x}(t) = f(x(t), u(t), t), \\\\\n       & x(0) = 0, \\\\\n       & h(x(T)) = 0.\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe Hamiltonian is defined as\n\\[\n  H(x, u, t, \\mu, \\lambda) = \\lambda^{\\top} f(x, u, t) + \\mu L(x(t), u(t), t)\n\\]\nPontryagin’s Maximum Principle can then be written as follows:\n\n\\(\\mu(t), \\lambda(t) \\neq 0\\);\n\\(\\dot{\\lambda}(t) = -H_{x}\\);\n\\(H(x(t), u^{*}(t), t) \\geq H(x(t), u(t), t)\\) for all feasible \\(u\\);\nBoundary conditions at the terminal time \\(T\\):\n\nFree end point: \\(\\lambda(T) = 0\\),\nClamped (fixed) end point: \\(\\lambda(T)\\) is unrestricted.\n\n\nNote that the free-end-point condition corresponds to the transversality condition for the finite-horizon problem."
